# Impact of Robot Encouragement on User Willingness to Re-engage with the Robot in Task Collaboration

## About The Project

Encouragement has been shown to enhance engagement, motivation, and task performance. This project explores whether these effects persist when encouragement is provided by a social robot, specifically the Furhat robot. Participants are tasked with folding an origami figure under two experimental conditions:

1. **Encouragement Condition**: The robot provides positive feedback and supportive cues.
2. **No Encouragement Condition**: The robot delivers task-focused instructions without encouragement.

### Objectives
- Assess if robot encouragement influences willingness to re-engage with the robot.
- Determine if encouragement affects task completion time.

### Key Hypotheses
- Encouragement leads to faster task completion.
- Encouragement increases willingness to interact with the robot again.

## Methodology

### Participants
- 20-30 participants recruited from the KTH University community.
- Random assignment to one of two conditions: Encouragement or No Encouragement.

### Experimental Setup
- **Robot**: Furhat social robot with speech and non-verbal behaviors.
- **Task**: Participants fold a simple origami figure following the robot’s step-by-step instructions.
  - Encouragement Condition: Positive feedback and engaging behaviors.
  - No Encouragement Condition: Minimal feedback and task-focused interaction.

### Procedure
1. Participants sign a consent form and receive an introduction.
2. They perform the origami task guided by the robot.
3. Interaction lasts 5-10 minutes.
4. Post-task survey measures willingness to re-engage and gathers qualitative feedback.

### Measures
- **Primary**:
  - Willingness to re-engage (Yes/No).
  - Task completion time (in seconds).
- **Secondary**:
  - Open-ended feedback on the robot interaction experience.

### Analysis
- Chi-square test for willingness to re-engage.
- T-test for task completion time.
- Thematic analysis for qualitative feedback.

## Results
Pending final analysis, the study aims to provide insights into:
- The role of robot encouragement in enhancing task efficiency and engagement.
- Patterns in user feedback regarding robot interaction.
