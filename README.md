# Impact of Robot Encouragement on User Perception in Task Collaboration

## 🧠 About the Project

Encouragement has been shown in psychological and educational contexts to improve motivation, performance, and engagement. This study explores whether these benefits extend to **human-robot interaction (HRI)** — specifically, whether **encouragement from a social robot** affects how users perceive the robot during a collaborative task.

Using the **Furhat social robot**, we designed an experiment where participants completed an origami folding task under one of two conditions:

1. **Encouragement Condition** – the robot provided verbal positive reinforcement during the task.
2. **No Encouragement Condition** – the robot gave the same task instructions without emotional or encouraging language.

This project aimed to understand whether subtle social cues, such as encouragement, affect **likability**, a critical component of human-robot rapport.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Determine whether robot encouragement improves **user-perceived likability**.
- Examine how robot social behaviors affect **user experience** in task-oriented collaboration.
- Provide design implications for the development of **socially intelligent robots** in domains like education, customer service, and therapy.

## 🧪 Methodology

### Participants
- 18 KTH students (9 per condition)  
- Age range: 18–44 (M = 23.44)  
- Mixed experience with robots; most were origami beginners

### Experimental Setup
- **Robot**: [Furhat](https://furhatrobotics.com/) — a social robot with facial gestures, head movements, and natural language capabilities.
- **Task**: Participants folded an origami fish, following the robot’s verbal step-by-step instructions. Visual aids were provided via screen-sharing (wizarded) for clarity.
- **Encouragement Examples**: “You’re doing great!”, “That looks really good so far.”
- **Control Condition**: Same task instructions, but encouragement replaced with neutral content (e.g., origami trivia), keeping word count balanced.

### Procedure
1. Participants were briefed and signed consent forms.
2. They interacted with the robot during the task (~10–15 minutes).
3. After completion, participants filled out the **Godspeed Questionnaire** (Likability subscale).
4. Debriefing followed to explain the study's purpose and answer questions.

### Measures
- **Primary**: Robot **likability** via 5-point Likert scales (e.g., Dislike–Like, Unfriendly–Friendly)
- **Secondary**: Open-ended qualitative feedback (optional)

### Analysis
- Independent-sample **t-test** comparing overall likability scores between the two conditions.
